# Calculator App

Welcome to the Calculator App! This app is built using Kotlin and Jetpack Compose, designed to give you the same smooth experience as the default iPhone calculator.

## Functionality 

Here’s what the app can do:

* [x] **Easy-to-read Display:** Shows the current number or the result of your calculations.
* [x] **Basic Arithmetic:** You can perform addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division with ease.
* [x] **Clear Input:** The 'C' button allows you to clear the current input and start fresh.
* [x] **Change Sign:** The '+/-' button lets you switch the sign of the current number.
* [x] **Percentage:** The '%' button converts the current number into a percentage.
* [x] **Smart Layout:** The '0' button takes up twice the width of other buttons, making it easier to find and press. The display area also occupies twice the height of other rows for better readability.
* [x] **Consistent Design:** Every component has a margin of 2dp, and a text size of 30sp for buttons, with the display text set at a large and clear 80sp.

### Extensions

We have plans for future enhancements, including:

* [ ] **Advanced Functions:** Adding more complex operations and functions to the calculator.
* [ ] **UI Enhancements:** Improving the user interface with animations and design tweaks.
* [ ] **State Persistence:** Ensuring the calculator remembers its state even when you close the app.

## Notes

### Challenges & Learnings

Building this app was a fantastic learning experience! Here are some of the challenges we encountered and overcame:

- **Design Accuracy:** Matching the layout and design to the iPhone calculator using Jetpack Compose required meticulous attention to detail.
- **State Management:** Handling state for various operations and ensuring the display showed the correct results was tricky but rewarding.
- **Layout Configuration:** Ensuring that the '0' button was twice as wide and that the display occupied the correct amount of space took some experimentation with Jetpack Compose’s layout system.

Thanks for checking out the Calculator App! We hope it makes your calculations easier and more enjoyable.
